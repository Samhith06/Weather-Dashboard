## Features

- **Recent Searches**: Stores up to 5 recent search locations for quick access, persisted in local storage.
- **Geolocation Support**: Automatically fetches weather data for the user's current location using the browser's geolocation API.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices with a modern, dark-themed UI.
